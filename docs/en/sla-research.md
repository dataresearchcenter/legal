1.2 We may use your organization’s name and logo on our website (e.g., under “Clients” or “Projects”) and in social media communications. You may opt out of such use at any time, either globally or on a per-request basis, by notifying us.

1.3 We will usually provide an initial response to your request within no more than 4 business days (Defined as any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday officially observed in Berlin, Germany). Depending on the complexity, this response may include the completed research, follow-up questions, or suggestions for refining or narrowing the scope of the request.

1.4 We will invoice you monthly for services provided, based on hours worked and rounded up to the nearest whole hour, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You may request a statement of accrued fees and hours worked at any time.

By submitting a request to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license to store and copy the content of your research request. This is required to enable us to provide our services. We do not publish your request or disclose their content.

2.2 If another customer submits a materially similar request, we may (while preserving anonymity) notify both customers and suggest collaboration. We will share any outputs only after both customers provide explicit consent. You may opt out of this mutual informing at any time, either globally or on a per-request basis, by notifying us.

2.3 You are solely responsible for the legality and appropriateness of your research requests. You agree to use caution when submitting your research requests and you avoid including any content in such request that may result in criminal or civil liability.
